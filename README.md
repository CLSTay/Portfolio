Examples of previous work

- Homepage.html is one of my earlier projects and had a few more pages with it but they didn't show anything too different so I just kept the one for demonstration purposes especailly since I already have another project using html on here.

- Website.zip contains a mock website using html and includes a style sheet. This is a test website I had built during college. This was used to prove that I could make a website and change whatever I wanted which is why the design is a little strange as I had to put obvious colours on all elements.

- There is also a small javascript complitation that I had made to show off some example of Javascript work. 

I had spent the most time with Javascript and C# however no longer have access to any of the work I had done for them but was able to find some old examples of HTML
