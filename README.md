examples of previous work

- Homepage.html is one of my earlier projects and had a few more pages with it but they didn't show anything too different so I just kept the one for demonstration purposes especailly since I already have another project using html on here.

- Website.zip contains a mock website using html and includes a style sheet. This is a test website I had built during college. This was used to prove that I could make a website and change whatever I wanted which is why the design is a little strange as I had to put obvious colours on all elements.
